        attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, 
        Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of 
        armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to 
        obtain metal limbs called "automail" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.` ,

        `Three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of 
        Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, 
        the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, 
        but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves 
        if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.`

        synopsis: [`To the average person, psychic abilities might seem a blessing; for Kusuo Saiki, however, this couldn't be further from the truth. 
        Gifted with a wide assortment of supernatural abilities ranging from telepathy to x-ray vision, he finds this so-called blessing to be nothing 
        but a curse. As all the inconveniences his powers cause constantly pile up, all Kusuo aims for is an ordinary, hassle-free life—a life where 
        ignorance is bliss.`,
    
        `Unfortunately, the life of a psychic is far from quiet. Though Kusuo tries to stay out of the spotlight by keeping his powers a secret from his 
        classmates, he ends up inadvertently attracting the attention of many odd characters, such as the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun 
        Kaidou. Forced to deal with the craziness of the people around him, Kusuo comes to learn that the ordinary life he has been striving for is a lot 
        more difficult to achieve than expected.`
